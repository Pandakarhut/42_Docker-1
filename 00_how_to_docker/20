# 20. Create an overlay-type internal network that you will name overmind.

# Run the following command on the manager node (virtualbox)

docker network create -d overlay overmind

# The output will be the ID of the network. You can list networks with:

docker network ls

# -d means driver. So we use 'overlay' driver and name it overmind. This overlay network will be used by the two swarm nodes' services

# to be connected to each other.
