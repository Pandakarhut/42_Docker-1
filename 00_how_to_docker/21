# 21. Launch a rabbitmq SERVICE that will be named orbital-command. You should

# define a specific user and password for the RabbitMQ service, they can be whatever

# you want. This service will be on the overmind network.

# RabbitMQ is a messaging broker, lets applications send and read messages.

# One service can write something and another service can later read it and do something.

# Run on the manager node:

docker service create -d --name orbital-command --network=overmind -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=jtian -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=1 rabbitmq

# A docker service can run multiple instances of an image on multiple nodes at the same time.

# Here we are only running one replica on one node.
