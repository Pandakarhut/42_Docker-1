# These commands were run to install docker on the VirtualBox. It is already done:
# There are two network adapters in the virtual machine: NAT and Host-Only network
# NAT adapter is used so VM can communicate with Internet, Host-Only network used so the VM can communicate with Mac.

# First, update your existing list of packages:

sudo apt update

# Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS:

sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common

# Then add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Add the Docker repository to APT sources:

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

# Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:

sudo apt update

# Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Debian repo:

apt-cache policy docker-ce

# Finally, install Docker:

sudo apt install docker-ce
